# CONTRIBUTING

The list is a Work in Progress (WIP). Still a bunch missing. If you want to help by fixing spelling mistakes, duplicates or just add more game decomps, You're more than welcome to!
There are 3 supported methods to contribute:

1. RECOMMENDED: [Pull Request/Issue](#PR/ISSUE)
2. RECOMMENDED: Tell me the decomp/issue in the "Game Decompilations" Thread in #project-updates in The [FMHY Server](https://rentry.co/fmhy-invite)
3. [Email](mailto:me@samidy.com)


# IMPORTANT 
If you're adding a game decomp, make sure it isnt already on the index already. first, use the search on the [Main Site](https://decomps.samidy.com), if nothing comes up, make sure it isnt already on there by going [Here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SamidyFR/Game-Decompilations/refs/heads/main/README.md), Pressing Ctrl+F and inputting the decomp link.
